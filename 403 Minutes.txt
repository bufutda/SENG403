01/25/17 - Initial Tutorial (Sprint Description) Minutes:

- Building alarm clock
- Can use any platform (web, phone, desktop, tablet, etc.)
- Not raspberry pi
- 12 hour time for now
- FULL SCREEN IDEAL (not req)

- 7: Daily repeating alarms
- 8: Schedule an alarm for a day of the week (ex: Tuesdays+Thursdays, just Mondays)

- 11: Set snooze time period (snooze after 10 min, 1 hour, etc.)
- - - Global setting
- Have to be present for demo
- No preference of time zone handling
- Should have an easy way to change time/date mid test for demoes
- As many as possible done, but ~ 3 acceptable for first sprint.
- Midway through term major change to product happening.
- Moving to a google doc for notes
- Attendance still on spreadsheet
- Android app (android studio)
- Roles need to be assigned next meeting
- For next meeting: 
- - Figure out when our next meeting is (any combo of tutorial meetings and outside meetings adding to 2)
- - - Majority vote
- - - Read notes
- - - Test to make sure git commits work over android studio
- - - Connor getting gavel for meetings
- - Download Android App Studio
- First 4 requirements for first sprint
- Sawatzky gave Ruble git training 01/25/17

01/26/17 - Standup #1 Minutes:

- About to start development
- At the very least want to get the first 3 requirements done
- - Can assess if any more are possible/realistic once development gets underway
- Meeting in Wednesday tutorials + our 2 standup meetings
- - Monday tutorial Ruble/Stern are going to attend to ensure we don't miss anything

01/31/17 - Standup $2 Minutes:

- Not enjoying Android App Studio/finding many things to aid us
- - At this stage of project it may be easier to port it over to
- Began discussing the user stories/burndown/board section of the project

02/01/17 - Tutorial Meeting #2 Minutes:

- Designing/syncing between group members on Android app not as easy as predicted
- - To solve this we're moving to a javascript web-app
- - Hosted on Sawatzky's website (.watz.ky/alarmclock/)
- - Sawatzky leading development, Newman leading testing
- - With this style it looks like we can do the first ~6 requirements for the sprint
- Stern working on user stories to help with development
- Rudy considering/committing to burndown charts to aid development
- Ruble has board made for our meetings to track our progress
- Gavel currently shipping for meetings

02/02/17 - Standup #3 Minutes:

- Web-app has made development much nicer
- Set up github page to store all of the code we have
- Webpage is set to update based on github state
- Currently have the digital/analog clock design made and functioning
- - Need to fix odd behaviour of clock arms rotating past 0, though.
- Stern made starfish chart
- Ruble brought interim pencil gavel

02/07/17 - Standup #4 Minutes:

- Web-app is looking even better than originally thought
- All 11 requirements being done seems feasible
- Only need to implement repeating alarms to complete this
- A few bugs (documented on the github) to fix for tomorrow, but that shouldn't be an issue

02/08/17 - Tutorial Meeting #3 (sprint demo #1) Minutes:

- All 11 requirements met
- All bugs fixed
- TA seemed happy with our progress
- Only thing left for sprint report is collecting our paperwork into a compact report


02/09/17 - Standup #5 Minutes:

- Sprint went quite well
- Waiting for instruction for next sprint
- Need to put all of the paperwork we've done together to finish report
- - Collaborate over Slack to organize that
